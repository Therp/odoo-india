Autogeneration of internal reference of a product.
===================================================
An automatic Internal Reference of the product is generated depending on the coding method you select on a product. Allows two ways of coding:

* Based on product categories
* Based on major and sub groups

You can also create major and sub groups of products and based on the code provided on those groups it creates an internal reference of a product by combining both.
